# RabbitMQ
Project in events oriented programming, using RabbitMQ

1. What's the project about?
Scenario: You are building a simplified backend system for an e-commerce platform.
When a customer places an order,
the order details must be broadcast to multiple downstream services (e.g., inventory management, billing, and shipping) via RabbitMQ.

2.The full Urlâ€™s and type of API request to generate the producer and the consumer applications.

Producer:  
URL: "http://<hostname>:5002/create-order"  

Consumer:  
URL: "http://<hostname>:5001/order-details"  


3.What type of exchange you chose and why?
 
Exchange Type: fanout  
Reason: I used a fanout exchange since i wanted, for this exersice,  all consumers to receive every message.
Also, This setup also allows adding more consumers in the future without modifying the producer logic.



4.Is there a binding key on the consumer? If so, what is it and why?

No Binding Key is Used, A fanout exchange ignores binding keys


5.Which service declared the exchange and queue and why?

Exchange Declaration:  
Declared by the Producer.  
Reason: The producer needs the orders exchange to exist before publishing messages.

Queue Declaration:  
Declared by the Consumer.  
Reason: The consumer declares a temporary queue (with `exclusive=True`) to receive messages during its runtime, therefore no need for the Producer to declare queue aswell.
